=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
124 153 97

Your Code's output is: 
None

It's Correct output is: 
124


=== EXPLANATION ===
Notice that when you call the function `range` with 2 arguments, if the first argument is larger than the second one, the returned range will be empty. In this failing test case, `range(B, C)` is empty (because B > C) and thus, A is not returned even though it should be.
