=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
13 39 485

Your Code's output is: 
13

It's Correct output is: 
39


=== EXPLANATION ===
Your program always sets `a` equals to `A`, then returns the min(A, max(B, C)) as the result. However, this is not the correct algorithm. In this failing test case, when A is the minimum, your program incorrectly returns A.
