=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
13 39 485

Your Code's output is: 
13

It's Correct output is: 
39


=== EXPLANATION ===
You should return B if A<B<C or A>B>C (your algorithm only considers the case A>B>C). In this failing test case, since A<B<C, your algorithm doesn't return B but instead returns A.
The save problem happens with return C.
