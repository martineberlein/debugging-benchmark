=== EXPLANATION ===
The loop in line 8: the upper bound of the range needs to be larger. In this failing test case, value `1` is the smallest, but it is swapped only 2 times (and cannot reach the beginning of the list) due to being the 2nd element from the back. The fix is to set the upper bound to `n-1`.
