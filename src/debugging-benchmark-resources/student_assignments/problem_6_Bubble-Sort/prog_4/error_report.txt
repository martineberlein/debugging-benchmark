=== EXPLANATION ===
Bubble Sort has 2 loops, the outer one and the inner one. After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the last i elements in the list are in the correct order and thus, in the next iterations we don't need to consider these last i elements anymore. Your incorrect code instead assumes that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first -- not the last -- i elements are in the correct order. The fix is to change the range bound of in line 9 from `(I+1, n)` to `(1, n-i)`.
