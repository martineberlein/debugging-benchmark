=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
21 21

Your Code's output is: 
7

It's Correct output is: 
21


=== EXPLANATION ===
- The first bug is the current algorithm is wrong if `A` and `B` are equal (both are 21 in this failing test case). In this case, `A` (or `B`) is the GCD, but the algorithm does not consider this, but only consider the common divisors smaller than `A`.
- The second bug is that this algorithm is not efficient enough. It takes too much time for some test cases. The fix is to use the Euclidean algorithm for finding GCD.
