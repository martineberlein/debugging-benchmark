=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
6

Your Code's output is: 
3

It's Correct output is: 
2


=== EXPLANATION ===
Line 16-17: you shouldn't let `start=mid+1` when `mid*mid<x` because in some cases, the value of `mid` here is the correct result, and since you set `start=mid+1`, you exclude that correct result from further consideration.
