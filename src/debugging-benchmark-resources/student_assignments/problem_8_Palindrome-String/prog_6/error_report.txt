Your Code's output is: 
1

It's Correct output is: 
0


=== EXPLANATION ===
Since lists are mutable objects, when you call `ob.Reserve` in line 19, the list `S` is modified. In other words, `rev` and `S` are always the same and your algorithm always returns 1. The fix is to make another copy of S, keep it safe and compare it with `rev` at the end (instead of comparing `rev` and `S`).
