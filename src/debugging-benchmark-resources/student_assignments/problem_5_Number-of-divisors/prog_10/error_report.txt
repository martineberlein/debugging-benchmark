=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
1

Your Code's output is: 
1

It's Correct output is: 
0


=== EXPLANATION ===
- The check in line 14, you should check for `j % 3 == 0` rather than `j % 3`.
- The algorithm is not efficient enough. Its time complexity is O(N) while the expected time complexity is O(sqrt(N)). In fact, it is sufficient to consider the divisors of N upto sqrt(N) -- the divisors larger than sqrt(N) can be obtained from dividing N for the small divisors.
