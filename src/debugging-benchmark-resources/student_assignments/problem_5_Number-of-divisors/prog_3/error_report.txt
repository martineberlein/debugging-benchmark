=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
7
Your Code's output is: 
1
It's Correct output is: 
0


=== EXPLANATION ===
- Line 10: Notice that `(N//i)` may not always be a divisor of `N`. In this failing test case (N = 7), for i = 2, i != N//i and (N//i)%3 == 0, so the result is increased by 1, but in fact it shouldn't be.
