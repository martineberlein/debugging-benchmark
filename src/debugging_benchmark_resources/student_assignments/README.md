# Introductory Problems

This directory contains the introductory Python problems with buggy programs. All problems/programs are publicly availables on *geeksforgeeks.org*.

### Folder structure

This directory comprises multiple folders, each folder for one introductory problem. The folder structure for each problem is described below:
- `description.json`: this file contains metadata of the problem, including problem name, description, constraints, URL, etc.
- `reference1.py`: this file contains a reference solution for the problem.
- `tests.json`: this file contains sample test cases.
- `prog_{a_number}`: each of these folders features a buggy program written by a user on the platform. The structure inside each of the folder is described below:
  - `buggy.py`: this file contains the buggy program.
  - `fixed.py`: this file contains the fixed program.
  - `error_report.txt`: this file contains a failing test case (corresponding to the buggy program) given by the platform. We also add in a sample natural language explanation written by ourselves.

### Overview of the problems

Problem 1: GCD of two numbers <br/>
Given two positive integers A and B, find GCD of A and B.

Problem 2: Sieve of Eratosthenes <br/>
Given a number N, calculate the prime numbers up to N using Sieve of Eratosthenes.

Problem 3: nPr <br/>
Write a program to calculate nPr.

Problem 4: Fibonacci to N <br/>
Given a positive integer N. Calculate the Fibonacci series till the number N.

Problem 5: Number of divisors <br/>
Given an integer N, find the number of divisors of N that are divisible by 3.

Problem 6: Bubble Sort <br/>
Given an Integer N and a list arr. Sort the array using bubble sort algorithm.

Problem 7: Middle of Three <br/>
Given three distinct numbers A, B and C. Find the number with value in middle.

Problem 8: Palindrome String <br/>
Given a string S, check if it is palindrome or not.

Problem 9: Remove vowels from string <br/>
Given a string, remove the vowels from the string.

Problem 10: Square root of a number <br/>
Given an integer x, find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(âˆšx).

Problem 11: Merge two strings <br/>
Given two strings S1 and S2 as input, the task is to merge them alternatively i.e. the first character of S1 then the first character of S2 and so on till the strings end.
