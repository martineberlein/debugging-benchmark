=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
&%^oq^

Your Code's output is: 

It's Correct output is: 
&%^q^


=== EXPLANATION ===
Line 8: you check for whether `i` is in `S`, but it is obvious that `i` is in `S` (see line 7). This bug makes your algorithm always return an empty string. Probably you want to check for whether `i` is in `vol`, not in `S`.
