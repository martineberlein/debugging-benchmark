eicm

Your Code's output is: 
ecm

It's Correct output is: 
cm


=== EXPLANATION ===
Line 9: each time this line is executed, `x` is assigned a value that is not related its old value. In other words, your changes do not add up.
Your algorithm is not efficient enough because the method `.replace` take O(len(S)) time complexity. Since you may call this method O(len(S)) times, the total complexity of your algorithm is O(len(S)^2), which exceeds the expectation for this problem.
