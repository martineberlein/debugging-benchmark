=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
1

Your Code's output is: 
0 1

It's Correct output is: 
0 1 1


=== EXPLANATION ===
- if N == 1, the list of Fibonacci numbers should be [0, 1, 1], not [0, 1] -- see this failing test case.
- in case N > 1, you forget to include the first two Fibonnaci numbers (i.e. 0 and 1) in the result.
- in case N > 1, this algorithm returns the list of N Fibonacci numbers instead of the Fibonacci numbers up to N.
