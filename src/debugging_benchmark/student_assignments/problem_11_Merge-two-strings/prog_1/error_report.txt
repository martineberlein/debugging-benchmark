=== ERROR REPORT ===
Input:
Bye Hello

Output:
TLE


=== EXPLANATION ===
Inside the `while` loop in line 12, if the length of S1 is smaller than the length of S2, the loop will run forever because nothing is added to `c`. The fix is to make the  `if` statement in line 15-16 outside of the `if` statement in line 13-14.
