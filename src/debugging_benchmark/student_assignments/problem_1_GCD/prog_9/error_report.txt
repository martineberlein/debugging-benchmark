=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
8 80

Your Code's output is: 
0

It's Correct output is: 
8


=== EXPLANATION ===
Line 11 returns B, however, actually we should return the non-zero value (so we should return A if B is zero). In this failing example, after the `while` loop in line 6, we have B = 0 and A = 8 and thus A should be returned (instead of B).
