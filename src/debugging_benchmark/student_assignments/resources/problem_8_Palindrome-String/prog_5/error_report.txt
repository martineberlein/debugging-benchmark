=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
qmoeeomq
Your Code's output is: 
0
It's Correct output is: 
1


=== EXPLANATION ===
- The first bug is: in line 6, you should `return check(s, si+1, ri-1)` instead of just calling it.
- The second bug is: this recursion algorithm takes too much stack memory to run for large input. The fix is to convert this recursion into a loop.
