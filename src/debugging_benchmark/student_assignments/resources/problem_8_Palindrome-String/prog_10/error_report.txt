=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
h

Your Code's output is: 
None

It's Correct output is: 
1


=== EXPLANATION ===
The `return` statement in line 21 should be outside of the `for` loop. In this failing test case, since you put the `return` statement inside the `for` loop and the `for` loop has no iteration, nothing is returned.
Furthermore, we only return ` if all symmetric positions match.
