=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
TjR GxPRYtwyy

Your Code's output is: 
TGjxRPyRyYwttwYyRy

It's Correct output is: 
TGjxRPRYtwyy


=== EXPLANATION ===
Line 8: note that `min([S1,S2])` will return the string (either `S1` or `S2`) that is the smallest in alphabetical order. For example, in this failing test case, it will return S2. With this line of code, you probably want to assign to `tis` the length of the shortest string, which is `tis=min([len(S1),len(S2)])`.
