                # ANNOTATE: if `m` -- the length of `b`-- is more than `i`, add `b[i]` to the result `c`. You made a bug here: this `if` statement should not be inside the body of the `if` statement above. Since you did this, the loop will run forever if the length of S1 is smaller than the length of S2.
                if i < m:
                    c += b[i]
            # ANNOTATE: increase the index `i` by 1
            i += 1
        # ANNOTATE: return the result `c`
        return c
