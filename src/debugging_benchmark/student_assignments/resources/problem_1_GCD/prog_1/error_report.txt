Your Code's output is: 
5

It's Correct output is: 
1


=== EXPLANATION ===
In line 8, the `return` statement is inside the `while` loop, this means the loop is executed for at most 1 iteration. This `return` statement should be outside of the `while` loop. Fixing this makes the code correctly implement the Euclidean algorithm for finding GCD.
