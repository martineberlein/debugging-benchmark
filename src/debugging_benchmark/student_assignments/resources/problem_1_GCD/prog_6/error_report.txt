=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
21 21

Your Code's output is: 
7

It's Correct output is: 
21


=== EXPLANATION ===
- The first error is: this algorithm only consider divisors smaller than `max(A, B)` (line 7). In this failing test case, A = B = 21 and thus the GCD should be 21. However, the algorithm only considers divisors from 1 to 20.
- The second error is: this algorithm works but takes too much time for larger inputs. The fix is to use the Euclidean algorithm.
