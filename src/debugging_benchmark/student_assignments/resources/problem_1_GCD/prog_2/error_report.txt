=== ERROR REPORT ===
For Input: 
43 38

Your Code's output is: 
None

It's Correct output is: 
1


=== EXPLANATION ===
- The first bug is in line 7: variable `i` should be looped until value 1 so that the algorithm will return something if `A` and `B` are co-prime numbers. In this failing test case, since the 2 input numbers are co-prime, nothing is returned.
- The second bug is that this algorithm takes too much time for some test cases. The fix is to use the Euclidean algorithm for finding GCD.
